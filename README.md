The purpose of this book is to showcase the amazing expertise of our guest speakers at the North American MVPDays Community Roadshow.   They have so much passion, expertise, and expert knowledge that it only seemed fitting to write it down in a book.   

MVPDays was founded by Cristal and Dave Kawula back in 2013. It started as a simple idea; “There’s got to be a good way for Microsoft MVPs to reach the IT community and share their vast knowledge and experience in a fun and engaging way” I mean, what is the point in recognizing these bright and inspiring individuals, and not leveraging them to inspire the community that they are a part of.
We often get asked the question “Who should attend MVPDays”?   
Anyone that has an interest in technology, is eager to learn, and wants to meet other like-minded individuals.   This Roadshow is not just for Microsoft MVP’s it is for anyone in the IT Community.
Make sure you check out the MVPDays website at: www.mvpdays.com. You never know maybe the roadshow will be coming to a city near you.

The goal of this particular book is to give you some amazing Master PowerShell tips from the experts you come to see in person at the MVPDays Roadshow.   Each chapter is broken down into a unique tip and we really hope you find some immense value in what we have written.
